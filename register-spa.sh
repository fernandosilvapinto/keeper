# baseUrl tells the provider where this application lives. Without it, its
# pages have nowhere to send a visitor who changed their mind: the "back to the
# application" link the theme renders on every information and error screen
# simply does not appear. A one-way door is a design defect, not a security
# measure.

# frontchannelLogout=false on purpose. Front-channel logout works by having the
# provider load one iframe per application during sign-out, so it depends on
# third-party cookies — which browsers are removing. Left on without a
# frontchannel.logout.url it also does nothing at all, which is worse than
# being off: it advertises a guarantee the system does not keep. Propagating a
# sign-out to other applications is back-channel logout's job, and that needs a
# server-side endpoint per application.
#
# fullScopeAllowed=false on purpose. With it left on — Keycloak's default — the
# token carries every role the person holds anywhere in the realm, so signing
# in to one application yields a credential that opens every other API that
# person can reach. Closed, the client only receives the permissions of the
# APIs whose client scope it was given below.
